This should be working properly. Worked on my machine using-> node main.js
This is actually the second program I have made for this.
The first one got deleted after VS Code crashed on my? (Never Happend Before)
Almost glad it did though. This version is more refined and cleaner since I started from scratch again.
After second go at it, I did the wise suggestion of using GIT.

P.S. Would love to know if there is a better way to use readline other than making a Promise?  
Also you can play with a friend or against an AI (I did both thinking the requirements said both)
Player one can choose which symbol they want to use.
I also did the grad requirements of needing to remember the User(s) name (it does address both people and or the ai as you play)
I also believe I met the "good coding practices" (SOLID) model style with simple descriptive naming?
